Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! This game can incorporate either two players 
or one player against a computer class. This game incporporates a 'best of three' round model, 
where the winner of 2 rounds will be the overall game winner. In each round, both players will
select one of the five game gestures: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock. 
The gestures act as follows:

Rock crushes Scissors 
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock 

If there is a tie there will be no winner for that round and the next round will begin.
The player with the winning gesture will win the round, and the rounds will continue until a winner is declared.
